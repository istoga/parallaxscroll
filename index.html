        <h2>What Is A Galaxy?</h2>
        <p>
            A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity.
            Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a in the middle.

        <h2>What Can You See?</h2>
        <p>
            When you look up at stars in the night sky, you’re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If it’s really dark, far away
            from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.

        <h2>There Are So Many</h2>
        <p>
            There are many galaxies besides ours, though. There are so many, we can’t even count them all yet! The looked at a small
            patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some scientists think there
            could be as many as galaxies in the universe.

        <h2>What Are Galaxies Shaped Like?</h2>
        <p>
            Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other galaxies are
            smooth and oval shaped. They’re called elliptical galaxies. And there are also galaxies that aren’t spirals or ovals.
            They have irregular shapes and look like blobs. The light that we see from each of these galaxies comes from the stars
            inside it.
